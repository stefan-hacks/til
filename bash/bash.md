## **1\. What is Shell Scripting?**[](#)

**Shell scripting** is writing a list of commands for your computer to run automatically.

**Think of it like this:**

- Normal: You type one command, wait, type another command, wait...
- Scripting: You write all commands in a file, then run them all at once!

### **Example 1.1: Simple Commands**

Try these in your terminal:

```bash
# See where you are
pwd

# List files
ls

# Create a file
touch test.txt

# Write to a file
**Happy Scripting! 🚀**
